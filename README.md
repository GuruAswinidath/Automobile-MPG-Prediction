# Automobile-MPG-Prediction

Introduction

This project is an implementation of an automatic MPG (miles per gallon) prediction model. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the fuel efficiency of automobiles based on various input features.
The Automatic MPG Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate the fuel efficiency of vehicles. By leveraging historical data on vehicle attributes such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin, the model can estimate the MPG value for a given set of input features.

The project utilizes a machine learning algorithm, specifically regression, to learn patterns from the training data and make accurate predictions on unseen instances
